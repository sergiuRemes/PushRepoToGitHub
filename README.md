PushRepoToGitHub is my project for "How to push code to GitHub with command line"

It explains step-by-step (with pictures :) how to push code using command line and VirtualStudioCode on Windows.

Read the project and try to follow it, and if something does not work or I was not clear please give me a shout! 
Hope this helps and if anyone wants to ad a commit to this project it would be great.
